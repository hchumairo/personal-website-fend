This project is part of Udacity Front End Nanodegree Program.

I use someone else's design, which is distributed for free and can be used. Here is the link to the design file https://www.figma.com/community/file/1146743712372485298/Client-First-Template-12---Blog

Some of the images I used, I have listed the source in the web and the rest I took from Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/).
